### Hey, I'm mtik00

I've been a software engineer for almost 30 years now.  I've mainly been focused on test automation, but I've also had a lot of experience in DevSecOps/SRE/Platform/etc, docker/k8s, ci/cd, and much more.

My favorite language is 🐍, by a long shot!  A good friend always says:

> Python is the second best language for every problem.

I totally agree.

Here are some statistics provided by the great [readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats) app:
